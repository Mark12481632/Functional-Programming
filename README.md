# This project is meant to acheive 3 things:
#
# 1. Help familiarize with the 3 Python tools:
#    - VS Code editor for Python
#    - Ruff for code formating and checking.
#    - uv for project, environment and package management.
# 2. Use typing to get some familiarity with it.
# 3. Review Functional Programming through a simple project.
#

# Here is the simple project requirements:
# ============
Here’s a good project idea:

Project: Immutable Employee Payroll Processor
Goals:

Use functional programming (map, filter, reduce, immutability).
Use type checking throughout.
Example tasks:

Load immutable employee data (NamedTuple).
Filter employees by department or status.
Calculate total payroll (reduce).
Generate department-wise payroll reports.
Fully typed, immutable objects only.
You’ll practise:

map, filter, reduce
Type annotations + mypy
Immutability
Lazy processing where needed.
